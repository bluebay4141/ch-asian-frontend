        Travel Insurance

      <p className="font-Helvetica text-base text-hero-3 font-normal leading-5">
        The company strongly recommends guests arrange travel insurance to cover cancellations and delays due to unforeseen circumstances, or those beyond all control (e.g. inclement weather, strikes, seismic events). It is also recommended guests arrange medical and personal insurance to cover any medical expenses, loss of baggage, loss of personal belongings, or other such travel mishaps. Guests agree both the company and any local partner operators are not liable for any of such unforeseen circumstances, and hold both parties harmless. All claims to reimbursements for insurance must go directly through the insurance provider.
